# GLCM-TextureToo

This is here for reference because this code had become homeless. By report, this code is no longer working with more recent releases of ImageJ. This is still the vintage v0.008 code, and I have made no attempt to update it or try to fix it.

Consider checking out forks / updates:
1. https://github.com/miura/GLCM2
2. Texture_too v 0.009 by Knut Kvaal (if you can find a copy online), here is the last known location from the wayback machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20131111064323/http://arken.umb.no/~kkvaal/eamtexplorer/imagej_plugins.html

Or consider checking out a number of other open source implementations of GLCM.

The LITERATURE REFERENCES in my code are still excellent, though. :)
